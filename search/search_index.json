SANDAG plans for many complex mobility issues facing the San Diego region, including development of the Regional Plan. Transportation models are complex analysis tools used to provide transportation planners and policymakers with information to help allocate scarce resources fairly and equitably. As we plan for the future, models are used to forecast potential future scenarios of where people will live and how they will travel. They are the principal tool used for alternatives analysis.  </p> <p>The SANDAG transportation model is an activity-based model (ABM). It simulates individual and household transportation decisions that make up their daily travel. This includes all trips people make on a daily basis, such as to work, school, shopping, healthcare, and recreation. An ABM provides a controlled, analytical platform so that different inputs and alternatives can be evaluated to predict whether, when, and how this travel occurs. SANDAG ABM accounts for a variety of different weekday travel markets in the region, including San Diego region resident travel, travel by Mexico residents and other travelers crossing San Diego County\u2019s borders, visitor travel, airport passengers at both the San Diego International Airport and the Cross Border Xpress bridge to the Tijuana International Airport, and commercial travel. </p> <p>The most recent version of the SANDAG ABM is referred to as \u201cABM3\u201d, and was developed for use in the 2025 Regional Plan. ABM3 is a significant enhancement from ABM2+ which was used for the 2021 Regional Plan. All of the passenger demand models in ABM2+ were converted from CT-RAMP to ActivitySim, including resident travel, cross-border travel, visitor travel, and airport travel. The internal-external travel component is now fully integrated with the resident model. The model was also enhanced to improve the representation of household and person-based mobility, vehicle fleet ownership, transit, shared and private micro-mobility, and micro-transit. Many of the model components were re-estimated using household survey data collected in 2022, and all model components were re-calibrated to base-year 2023 conditions. A new disaggregate commercial vehicle model was developed based upon a 2020 commercial vehicle survey, and implemented in ActivitySim.</p> <p>This website includes a description of the model system, how to set up and run the models, and a description of model inputs and outputs. Some aspects of the site are a work-in-progress, so we recommend that you check in often, and share your thoughts on ways to improve the site with SANDAG Transportation Modeling staff.

Aggregate models are used to model external-internal travel (from external stations other than the U.S./Mexico border crossing) and through travel. The model system relies on EMME software for network processing, skimming, and assignment. Models are mostly implemented in Python, and some models are implemented in [Java] (https://www.java.com/en/).</p> <p>The overall design of the model is shown in the figure below.</p> <p></p> <p>The system starts by performing initial input processing in EMME. This includes building transport networks and scenarios for skimming and assignment. An initial set of skims are created based on input trip tables (e.g. warm start). Then disaggregate choice models in ActivitySIm are run, including the resident model, the crossborder travel model, two airport ground access models, the overnight visitor model, and the commercial vehicle model. Next auxiliary models are run; the taxi/TNC routing model and the autonomous vehicle intra-household allocation model are run in Java. Aggregate external-internal and through travel models are run in Python. After all models are run, trip tables are built from the result and assigned to transport networks. A check is made to determine whether the model has reached convergence (currently this is set to three feedback iterations). If convergence is reached, outputs are processed for export to the SANDAG Datalake for reporting summaries. If not, speeds from assignment are averaged using method of successive averages, and skims are rebuilt for the next iteration. The model system is then re-run with the updated skims.</p> <p>ActivitySim is used to represent all internal travel and internal-external made by residents of the SANDAG region (modeled area).  The decision-makers in the model system include both persons and households. These decision-makers are created (synthesized) for each simulation year and land-use scenario, based on Census data and forecasted distributions of households and persons by key socio-economic categories. A similar but simplified method is used to generate disaggregate populations for cross-border, airport ground access, and overnight visitor models. The decision-makers are used in the subsequent discrete-choice models in a microsimulation framework where a single alternative is selected from a list of available alternatives according to a probability distribution.  The probability distribution is generated from a logit model which considers the attributes of the decision-maker and the attributes of the various alternatives. The application paradigm is referred to as Monte Carlo simulation, since a random number draw is used to select an alternative from the probability distribution. The decision-making unit is an important element of model estimation and implementation and is explicitly identified for each model specified in the following sections.</p> <p>A key advantage of using the micro-simulation approach is that there are essentially no computational constraints on the number of explanatory variables that can be included in a model specification.  However, even with this flexibility, the model system will include some segmentation of decision-makers.  Segmentation is a useful tool to both structure models (for example, each person type segment could have their own model for certain choices) and to characterize person roles within a household.  Segments can be created for persons as well as households.</p>"},{"location":"design.html#resident-model","title":"Resident Model","text":"<p>The resident model structure is based on the Coordinated Travel Regional Activity-based Modeling Platform (CT-RAMP). The figure below shows the resident model structure. In order to understand the flow chart, some definitions are required. These are described in more detail below.</p> <ul> <li>Tour: A sequence of trips that start and end at an anchor location. In ActivitySim, anchors are home or work.</li> <li>Primary destination: The \u201cmain\u201d activity of the tour; this activity determines the tour purpose. It also divides the tour into two \u201clegs\u201d; the sequence of trips from the anchor location to the primary destination is the outbound leg, and the sequence of trips from the primary destination back to the anchor location is the inbound or return leg.</li> <li>Mandatory activity: Work or school</li> <li>Non-mandatory activity: Any out of home activity that is not work or school, including maintenance activities such as shopping as well as discretionary activities such as out-of-home recreation and eating out.</li> <li>Fully joint tour: A tour in which two or more household members travel together to all out-of-home activity locations and return home together. In other words, no household member is picked-up or dropped-off en route.</li> <li>Intermediate stop: An out-of-home activity location on the tour other than the anchor location or the primary destination. Intermediate stops are made on the way from the anchor location to the primary destination (outbound) or on the way from the primary destination back to the anchor location (inbound).</li> <li>Tour mode: The \u201cmain mode\u201d or \u201cpreferred mode\u201d of the tour. This is an abstract concept used categorize the tour with respect to accessibility and constrain the availability of modes for trips on the tour to ensure some consistency of modes used for each trip.</li> </ul> <p>The resident model design is shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>The first model in the sequence is disaggregate accessibilities. This is a recent addition to ActivitySim in which the tour destination choice model is run for a prototypical sample population covering key market segments and destination choice logsums from the model are written out for each tour in the population. These destination choice logsums are then merged with the actual synthetic population and used as accessibility variables in downstream models such as auto ownership, coordinated daily activity patterns, and tour frequency. are mandatory location choice; this model is run for all workers and students regardless of whether they attend work or school on the simulated day.</p> <p>Next a set of long-term and mobility models are run. The first model in the sequence predicts whether an autonomous vehicle is owned by the household. This model conditions the next model, which predicts the number of autos owned. If an autonomous vehicle is owned, multiple cars are less likely. Next, the mandatory (work and school) location choice models are run. The work location choice models includes a model to predict whether the worker has a usual out-of-home work location or exclusively works from home. If the worker chooses to work from home, they will not generate a work tour. An external worker identification model determines whether each worker with an out-of-home workplace location works within the region or external to the region. If they work external to the region, the external station is identified. Any primary destination of any work tours generated by the worker will be the external station chosen by this model. A work location choice model predicts the internal work location of each internal worker, and a school location choice model predicts the school location of each student.</p> <p>Next, a set of models predicts whether workers and students have subsidized transit fares and if so, the percent of transit fare that is subsidized, and whether each person in the household owns a transit pass. A vehicle type choice model then runs, which predicts the body type, fuel type, and age of each vehicle owned by the household; this model was extended to predict whether each vehicle is autonomous, conditioned by the autonomous vehicle ownership model.</p> <p>Next, we predict whether each household has access to a vehicle transponder which can be used for managed lane use. We assume that all vehicles built after a certain year (configurable by the user) are equipped with transponders. Next we predict whether each worker has subsidized parking available at work. Finally we predict the telecommute frequency of each worker, which affects downstream models including the daily activity pattern model, the non-mandatory tour frequency model, and stop frequency models.</p> <p>Next the daily and tour level models are run. The first daily model is the daily activity pattern model is run, which predicts the general activity pattern type for every household member. Then Mandatory tours are generated for workers and students, the tours are scheduled (their location is already predicted by the work/school location choice model), a vehicle availability model is run that predicts which household vehicle would be used for the tour, and the tour mode is chosen. After mandatory tours are generated, a school pickup/dropoff model forms half-tours where children are dropped off and/or picked up at school. The model assigns chaperones to drive or ride with children, groups children together into \u201cbundles\u201d for ride-sharing, and assigns the chaperone task to either a generated work tour or generates a new tour for the purpose of ridesharing. Fully joint tours \u2013 tours where two or more household members travel together for the entire tour - are generated at a household level, their composition is predicted (adults, children or both), the participants are determined, the vehicle availability model is run, and a tour mode is chosen. The primary destination of fully joint tours is predicted, the tours are scheduled, the vehicle availability model is run, and a tour mode is chosen. Next, non-mandatory tours are generated, their primary destination is chosen, they are scheduled, the vehicle availability model is run, and a tour mode is chosen for each. At-work subtours are tours that start and end at the workplace. These are generated, scheduled (with constraints that the start and end times must nest within the start and end time of the parent work tour), a primary destination is selected, the vehicle availability model is run, and a tour mode is chosen.</p> <p>The major tour modes are shown below: <pre><code>flowchart TD\n    subgraph four\n    direction LR\n    E[Ride-Hail] --&gt; E1[Taxi]\n    E --&gt; E2[Single-pay TNC]\n    E --&gt; E3[Shared TNC];\n    end\n    subgraph three\n    direction LR\n    D[Transit] --&gt; D1[Walk Access]\n    D --&gt; D2[PNR Access]\n    D --&gt; D3[KNR Access]\n    D --&gt; D4[TNC Access]\n\n    D1 --&gt; D11[Local Only]\n    D1 --&gt; D12[Premium Only]\n    D1 --&gt; D13[Mixed]\n\n    D2 --&gt; D21[Local Only]\n    D2 --&gt; D22[Premium Only]\n    D2 --&gt; D23[Mixed]\n\n    D3 --&gt; D31[Local Only]\n    D3 --&gt; D32[Premium Only]\n    D3 --&gt; D33[Mixed]\n\n    D4 --&gt; D41[Local Only]\n    D4 --&gt; D42[Premium Only]\n    D4 --&gt; D43[Mixed]\n    end\n    subgraph two\n    direction LR\n    C[Active] --&gt; C1[Walk]\n    C --&gt; C2[Bike]\n    C --&gt; C3[E-Scooter]\n    C --&gt; C4[E-Bike]\n    end\n\n    subgraph one\n    direction LR\n    B[Auto] --&gt; B1[Drive-alone];\n    B --&gt; B2[Shared 2];\n    B --&gt; B3[Shared 3+];\n    end\n    A[Tour Mode] --&gt; one;\n    A --&gt; two;\n    A --&gt; three;\n    A --&gt; four;\n\n    classDef group1 fill:#f75f5f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px,font-size:26px,font-weight:bold;\n    classDef group2 fill:#ffd966,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,font-size:20px;\n    classDef group3 fill:#bdabf0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,font-size:18px;\n\n    classDef hiddenTitle color:transparent;\n    class one,two,three,four hiddenTitle;\n\n    class A group1;\n    class B,C,D,E group2;\n    class B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3,C4,D1,D2,D3,D4,E1,E2,E3,D11,D12,D13,D21,D22,D23,D31,D32,D33,D41,D42,D43 group3;\n</code></pre></p> <p>At this point, all tours are generated, scheduled, have a primary destination, and a selected tour mode.

Finally, the parking location of each auto trip to the central business district (CBD) is determined. After the model is run, the output files listed above are created.

Both models use the same structure and software code, though the parameters that control the total number of airport travel parties, off-airport destination, mode, arrival and departure times, and other characteristics, vary for each airport according to survey and airport-specific data. The airport ground access model simulates trips to and from the airport for residents, visitors, and external travelers. These trips are generated by arriving or departing passengers and are modeled as tours within the ActivitySim framework. A post processing script also generates trips to serve passengers who require a pickup or dropoff at the airport. For example, a passenger who is picked up at the airport generates two trips; one trip to the airport by the driver to pick up the air passenger(s), and another trip from the airport with the driver and the air passenger(s). It is important to note that, to work within the ActivitySim framework, the airport trips must be modeled as tours, rather than being generated directly as in the previous model. These tours are assigned an origin at the airport MGRA. During the stop frequency step of ActivitySim, a trip is assigned to the appropriate leg of the tour (either to or from the airport) while the opposite leg is not assigned any trips (referred to as the \u2018dummy leg\u2019). Passengers who are leaving on a departing flight and traveling to the airport are considered \u201cinbound,\u201d while arriving passengers are considered \u201coutbound\u201d.</p> <p>The overall design of the model is shown in the figure below.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Tour Enumeration: A list of airport travel parties is generated from input enplanements and transferring passenger rates, as well as distributions that describe the share of travel parties by purpose (business versus personal), household income, and party size.</li> <li> <p>Tour Level Models</p> <p>2.1 Tour Scheduling Probabilistic: The tour scheduling model uses a probabilistic draw of the scheduling distribution. This model assigns start and end times to the tour. This is important because it will also serve as the schedule model for the final airport trips. In ActivitySim, trips are scheduled based on the tour schedule. If there is only one trip per leg on the tour (such as our case here) the trip is assigned the tour start/end time.</p> <p>2.2 Tour Destination Choice: The destination choice model chooses the non-airport end of the airport trips. Each tour is set with an origin at the airport MGRA. The tour destination model of ActivitySim is used to choose the non-airport end of the trip. The utility equation includes the travel distance, and the destination size terms. ActivitySim destination choice framework requires a mode choice log sum. A dummy tour mode choice log sum was created which generates a value of zero for every destination using the \u2018tour_mode_choice.csv\u2019 and \u2018tour_mode_choice.yml\u2019 file. This is a work around to prevent ActivitySim from crashing and not having to include the tour mode choice log sum in the destination choice model.</p> <p>2.3 Stop Frequency Choice: The stop frequency model is where the trip table is first created. The pre-processor tags each tour with a direction of \u2018inbound\u2019 or \u2018outbound\u2019 according to whether the tour is a departing or arriving passenger. For the Airport Ground Access model, inbound tours are tagged with zero outbound trips and -1 inbound trips (and the opposite is true for outbound tours: -1 outbound trips and 0 inbound trips). The 0 signifies that no intermediate stops are made; this leg of the tour will only have one trip. The -1 signifies that no trip is made at all on that leg. Using the -1 allows us to create \u2018half-tours\u2019 where only one leg of the tour is recorded as a trip. 3. Trip Level Models</p> <p>3.1 Trip Departure Choice: The trip scheduling model assigns depart times for each trip on a tour. ActivitySim requires trip scheduling probabilities; however, these are not used in this implementation since there is only one trip on any given tour leg. This means the trips will be assigned the tour scheduling times which were determined in the tour scheduling model. The trip scheduling probabilities file is just a dummy file.</p> <p>3.2 Trip Mode Choice: Each trip is assigned a trip mode; in the Airport Ground Access Model, trip mode refers to the airport arrival mode which simultaneously predicts the arrival mode and the location which the passenger uses to access that model. The arrival modes are shown in the table below.  The trip mode choice yaml file contains detailed variables associated with each trip mode. For example, each parking location is given an MGRA location, a walk time, a wait-time, and a cost. If a parking location MGRA is set to -999 it is assumed to be unavailable and will not be in the choice set. The pre-processor in this step stores all values of skims from the trip origin to each of the access modes destinations along with any associated costs. Costs include parking fees per day, access fees, fares, and rental car charges. Employees are not fed into the trip mode choice model. Instead, if a transit share is specified in the employee park file, that percentage of employees will be assigned \u2018Walk Premium\u2019 mode in the pre-processor. Otherwise, employees are all assigned \u2018Walk\u2019 mode from the employee parking lot to the terminal.</p> <p>3.3 Airport Returns: Airport trips where the party is dropped of curbside or parked and escorted are assumed to also have the driver make a return trip to the non-airport location. This procedure is done as a post-processing step after mode choice and before trip tables are written out. An \u2018airport_returns.yml\u2019 file takes a user setting to determine which trip modes will include a return trip. These trips records are flagged and duplicated. The duplicated trips swap the origin and destination of the original trip and are assigned a unique trip id.

The trips are modeled as part of tours that begin and end at the place of lodging. However, unlike the resident model, the Overnight Visitor Model does not utilize a 24-hour activity schedule. Therefore it can be thought of as a simpler, tour-based model. Once each tour is generated, it is scheduled independently. The model uses the same time periods and modes as the resident model. The overall design of the model is shown in the figure below.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Tour Enumeration: A list of visitor parties is generated from the input household data and hotel room inventory at the MGRA level. Visitor travel parties by segment (business versus personal) are calculated based on separate rates for hotels and for households. Visitor parties are generated by purpose based on tour rates by segment, then attributed with household income and party size based on input distributions. There are three purposes in the Overnight Visitor model:</p> </li> <li> <p>Work:  Business travel made by business visitors.</p> </li> <li>Dining: Travel to food establishments for both business and personal visitors.</li> <li> <p>Recreational: All other non-work non-food related activities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tour Level Models</p> <p>2.1 Tour Scheduling Probabilistic: The tour scheduling model uses a probabilistic draw of the scheduling distribution. This model assigns start and end times to the tour. If there is only one trip per leg on the tour, the trip is assigned the tour start/end time.</p> <p>2.2 Tour Destination Choice: The destination choice model chooses the MGRA of the primary activity location on the tour.</p> <p>2.3 Tour Mode Choice: The tour mode choice model determines the primary mode of the tour.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stop Level Models</p> <p>3.1 Stop Frequency Choice: The stop frequency model predicts the number of stops by direction based on input distributions that vary by tour purpose.</p> <p>3.2 Stop Purpose: The stop purpose model chooses the activity purpose of each intermediate stop based on input distributions that vary according to tour purpose.</p> <p>3.3 Stop Location Choice: The location choice model chooses the MGRA for each intermediate stop on the tour.</p> </li> <li> <p>Trip Level Models</p> <p>4.1 Trip Departure Choice: The trip scheduling model assigns depart times for each trip on a tour based on input distributions that vary by direction (inbound versus outbound), stop number, and number of periods remaining on the tour.</p> <p>4.2 Trip Mode Choice: Each trip is assigned a trip mode, consistent with the modes in the resident model.</p> <p>4.3 Trip Assignment: Trips are aggregated by time of day, mode occupancy, value-of-time, and origin-destination TAZ and assigned simultaneously with other trips.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The major tour modes are shown below: <pre><code>flowchart TD\n    subgraph four\n    direction LR\n    E[Ride-Hail] --&gt; E1[Taxi]\n    E --&gt; E2[Single-pay TNC];\n    end\n    subgraph three\n    direction LR\n    D[Transit] --&gt; D1[Walk Access]\n\n    D1 --&gt; D11[Local Only]\n    D1 --&gt; D12[Premium Only]\n    D1 --&gt; D13[Mixed]\n    end\n    subgraph two\n    direction LR\n    C[Active] --&gt; C1[Walk]\n    end\n\n    subgraph one\n    direction LR\n    B[Auto] --&gt; B1[Drive-alone];\n    B --&gt; B2[Shared 2];\n    B --&gt; B3[Shared 3+];\n    end\n    A[Tour Mode] --&gt; one;\n    A --&gt; two;\n    A --&gt; three;\n    A --&gt; four;\n\n    classDef group1 fill:#f75f5f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px,font-size:26px,font-weight:bold;\n    classDef group2 fill:#ffd966,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,font-size:20px;\n    classDef group3 fill:#bdabf0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,font-size:18px;\n\n    classDef hiddenTitle color:transparent;\n    class one,two,three,four hiddenTitle;\n\n    class A group1;\n    class B,C,D,E group2;\n    class B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3,C4,D1,D2,D3,D4,E1,E2,E3,D11,D12,D13,D21,D22,D23,D31,D32,D33,D41,D42,D43 group3;\n\n</code></pre></p> <p>For more information on the Overnight Visitor Travel Model see technical documentation.</p>"},{"location":"faq.html","title":"FAQs","text":""},{"location":"faq.html#how-many-abm-versions-does-sandag-maintain","title":"How many ABM versions does SANDAG maintain?","text":"<p>There are four released ABM versions - ABM1, ABM2, ABM2+, and ABM3.</p>"},{"location":"faq.html#who-uses-the-sandag-abm-and-what-for","title":"Who uses the SANDAG ABM and what for?","text":"<p>The SANDAG ABM is used by SANDAG and many other public and private entities in the San Diego region.
