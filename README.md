SANDAG ABM
===

Welcome to the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) Activity-Based Model (ABM) code repository!

### Overview
The SANDAG ABM is a sophisticated transportation modeling tool that simulates individual and household travel behavior throughout the San Diego region. It captures a wide range of daily travel activities — including commuting to work or school, shopping, accessing healthcare, and recreation — by modeling the decisions that drive those trips.

### What is Modeled
The ABM accounts for a variety of weekday travel markets, including:
- **Resident travel** within the San Diego region
- **Cross-border travel** of Mexico residents traveling into the region
- **Visitor travel** of overnight visitors within the region
- **External travel** of non-residents crossing San Diego County’s borders
- **Airport passenger travel** convering:
  - San Diego International Airport
  - Cross Border Xpress (CBX) bridge to Tijuana International Airport
- **Commercial and freight travel**

### Purpose and Application
The SANDAG ABM plays a critical role in regional planning and policy development. It supports the creation of the Regional Plan, helping transportation planners and policymakers:
- Evaluate the performance of transportation projects
- Analyze the impacts of proposed policies
- Support data-driven decision-making on complex mobility issues in the region

### Documentation
