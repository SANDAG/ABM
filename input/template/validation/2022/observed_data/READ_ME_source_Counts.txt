During the week of 8/26/2024, we went through the process of
attempting to validate our highway counts by comparing the 
2016 and 2022 PeMS count data. We went through some iterations
of comparing the counts and omitting counts that made no
sequential sense in terms of flow. The source_Counts_backup.xlsx
is the original spreadsheet without any omissions while the 
source_Counts.xlsx is the spreadsheet we edited and includes
less counts than the original.
