# Inputs
land_use: "../../../../input/land_use.csv"
geometry: "../../../../input/mgra15.shp"


# Data input/outputs. These files serve as both inputs and output locations.
raw_parking_inventory: "../../../../input/mgra_parking_inventory.csv"      # Input for data reduction step
reduced_parking_costs: "../../../../output/parking/reduced_parking_costs.csv"     # Output from reduction and also input to imputation step
imputed_parking_costs: "../../../../output/parking/imputed_parking_costs.csv"     # Output from imputation and also input to district creation
district_data: "../../../../output/parking/district_data.csv"                     # Output from district creation and also input to aggregation
aggregated_street_data: "../../../../output/parking/aggregated_street_data.csv"   # Output from network data aggregation and input to space estimation
estimated_spaces_data: "../../../../output/parking/estimated_spaces.csv"          # Output from space estimation

# expected cost calculation requires
# - "imputed_parking_costs"
# - "estimated_spaces_data"
# - "district_data"

# Parameters
walk_dist: 0.5
walk_coef: -0.3

# Which models to run, comment out any that you wish to not run. 
# However, be sure that the input is ready for whatever the new first model is.
# For example, if you have parking data cleaned up already, it can be fed into the 'create_districts' model.
# Or if you manually estimated spaces, you can skip that model too.
models:
  - run_reduction
  - run_imputation
  - create_districts
  - run_space_estimation
  - run_expected_parking_cost
