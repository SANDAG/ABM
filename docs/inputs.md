# ABM3 Model Inputs

The main inputs to ABM3 include the transportation network, land-use data, synthetic population data, parameters files, and model specifications. Outputs include a set of files that describe travel decisions made by all travel markets considered by the model (residents, overnight visitors, airport ground access trips, commercial vehicles and trucks, Mexico residents traveling in San Diego County, and travel made by all other non-residents into and through San Diego County).

### File Types

There are several file types used for model inputs and outputs. They are denoted by their extension, as listed in the table below.

| **Extension** | **Format** | 
| --- | --- |
| .log, .txt | Text files created during a model run containing logging results. | 
| .yaml | Text files used for setting properties that control ActivitySim or some other process. | 
| .csv | Comma-separated value files used to store model parameters, input or output data. | 
| .omx | Open matrix format files used to store input or output trip tables or skims | 
| .h5 | HDF5 files, used to store pipeline for restarting ActivitySim | 
| .shp (along with other files - .cpg, .dbf, .prj, .shx) | ArcGIS shapefiles and associated files | 
| .html | Hypertext markup language files, open in web browser | 
| .png | Portable network graphics file, open in web browser, Microsoft photos, or third-party graphics editor |

### Highway Network Vehicle Class Toll Factors File
#### `vehicle_class_toll_factors.csv`

Required file. Used to specify the relative toll values by six vehicle classes by Facility name, scenario year and time of day. Can be used, for example, to identify "free for HOV" type managed lane facilties. Used by the Import network Modeller tool.

Example:

| Facility_name | Year | Time_of_Day | DA_Factor | S2_Factor | S3_Factor | TRK_L_Factor | TRK_M_Factor | TRK_H_Factor |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| I-15          | 2016 | EA          | 1.0       | 0.0       | 0.0       | 1.0          | 1.03         | 2.33         |
| SR-125        | 2016 | ALL         | 1.0       | 1.0       | 1.0       | 1.0          | 1.03         | 2.33         |
| I-5           | 2035 | ALL         | 1.0       | 1.0       | 0.0       | 1.0          | 1.03         | 2.33         |

The toll values for each class on each link are calculated by multiplying the input toll value from hwycov.e00 (ITOLLA, ITOLLP, ITOLLO) by this factor, matched by the Facility name (together with the toll factors from <a href="#hwy_link_off_peak_toll_factors">off_peak_toll_factors.csv</a> in converting ITOLLO to the off-peak times-of-day). 

The network links are matched to a record in this file based on the NM, FXNM or TXNM values (in that order). A simple substring matching is used, so the record with Facility_name "I-15" matches any link with name "I-15 SB", "I-15 NB", "I-15/DEL LAGO DAR NB" etc. The records should not be overlapping: if there are two records which match a given link it will be an arbitrary choice as to which one is used.

Note that if a link does not match to a record in this file, the default factors (specified in the table below) will be applied to said link. It is OK if there are records for which there are no link tolls.

### Highway Network Off-Peak Toll Factors File
#### `off_peak_toll_factors.csv`

Optional file. Used to specify different tolls in the off-peak time-of-day scenarios based on the single link ITOLLO field, together with the tolls by vehicle class from <a href="#hwy_link_vehicle_class_toll_factors">vehicle_class_toll_factors.csv</a>.
Used by the Import network Modeller tool.

Example:
```
Facility_name, OP_EA_factor, OP_MD_factor, OP_EV_factor
I-15,                  0.75,          1.0,         0.75
SR-125,                1.0 ,          1.0,         1.0
SR-52,                 0.8 ,          1.0,         0.8
```

See note re: network link matching under <a href="#hwy_link_vehicle_class_toll_factors">vehicle_class_toll_factors.csv</a>. Note that all facilities need not be specified, links not matched will use a factor of 1.0.

<a id="hwy_link_vehicle_class_availability"></a>

### Highway Network Vehicle Class Toll Factors File
#### `vehicle_class_availability.csv`

Optional file. Specifies the availability / unavailability of six vehicle classes for five times-of-day by Facility name. This will override any mode / vehicle class availability specified directly on the network (hwycov.e00), via ITRUCK and IHOV fields. Used in the generation of time-of-day Emme scenarios in the Master run Modeller tool.

Example:

| Facility_name | vehicle_class | EA_Avail | AM_Avail | MD_Avail | PM_Avail | EV_Avail |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| I-15          | DA            | 1        | 1        | 1        | 1        | 1        |

| I-15          | S3            | 1        | 0        | 1        | 0        | 1        |

See note re: network link matching under <a href="#hwy_link_vehicle_class_toll_factors">vehicle_class_toll_factors.csv</a>. Note that all facilities need not be specified, links not matched will use the availability as indicated by the link fields in hwycov.e00.
