# Calibration and Validation Overview

Travel models are usually calibrated and validated to match base year observed data. ABM3 base year was 2022 for the 2025 Regional Plan (RP). Following model development, ABM3 was calibrated and validated using a series of steps described in each of the following sections. Any significant bugs or feature updates might affect the match and trigger a re-calibration effort.
