# Release Notes

## Version 15.1.0 (September 3, 2024)
As mentioned in the notes for Version 15.0.2, several improvements to the Commercial Vehicle Model (CVM) were made, largely due to SANDAG staff realizing that the survey used to estimate the CVM had likely overestimated the amount of commercial vehicle travel that was made on a given day in the region. New weights were estimated, and then the CVM was recalibrated to match these new weights. After doing this, it was found that modeled highway volumes were lower than observed counts, so some further adjustments were made to get them back up. Some components of the resident model were recalibrated to better match the survey, a new database started being used, a bug in the transit network was fixed, and other miscelaneous improvements were made.

Go [here](https://dev.azure.com/SANDAG-ADS/ORTAD/_wiki/wikis/ORTAD.wiki/3/Comparison-abm_15_1_0-and-abm_15_0_0) to see detailed changes in the database and [here](https://dev.azure.com/SANDAG-ADS/ORTAD/_wiki/wikis/ORTAD.wiki/2/Release-Notes-for-abm_15_1_0-and-abm_15_1_0_reporting) for changes in the reporting tool.
- [PR 184](https://github.com/SANDAG/ABM/pull/184), [PR 186](https://github.com/SANDAG/ABM/pull/186), & [PR 193](https://github.com/SANDAG/ABM/pull/193): The number of EV chargers each year were updated using numbers given by planning, and recalibration was done to ensure that the EV ownership rates for no build scenarios matched the targets.
- [PR 178](https://github.com/SANDAG/ABM/pull/178), [PR 188](https://github.com/SANDAG/ABM/pull/188), & [PR 189](https://github.com/SANDAG/ABM/pull/189): In previous releases the crossborder model had its own constants.yaml file, which contained a lot of the same values in the common constants.yaml file, meaning that both files would need to be edited. The crossborder model now instead reads from the common constants.yaml file.

## Version 15.0.0 (May 23, 2024)
For use in the 2025 Region Plan (RP), SANDAG has developed a new activity-based travel model, known as ABM3. The biggest change from SANDAGâ€™s previous ABM, ABM2+, is the transition from the Java-based CT-RAMP modeling platform to the open-source Python-based [ActivitySim](https://research.ampo.org/activitysim/) platform that has been developed by a consortium of public agencies (of which SANDAG is a founding member) for the past decade. ABM3 will be the first ActivitySim model to be used in production for planning purposes. While most of the model components from ABM3 were translated from ABM2+, there were several notable enhancements that were made, which are described below. Further, several models were either re-estimated and/or recalibrated to match 2022 data.
### ActivitySim Version
- [SANDAG/activitysim v15.0.0](https://github.com/SANDAG/activitysim/releases/tag/v15.0.0): This is based on a fork of the ActivitySim consortium repo and customized code in [BayDAG_estimation](https://github.com/SANDAG/activitysim/tree/BayDAG_estimation) branch.
- [SANDAG/activitysim-cvm v15.0.0](https://github.com/SANDAG/activitysim-cvm/releases/tag/v15.0.0): This specific version of ActivitySim is required to run the new Commercial Vehicle Model (CVM) in ABM3. It is based on a fork of the ActivitySim repo under [CamSys](https://github.com/camsys/activitysim) and customized code in [time-settings](https://github.com/SANDAG/activitysim-cvm/tree/time-settings) branch.
