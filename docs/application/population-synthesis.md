# Population Synthesis

SANDAG maintains a private repository called Population-Sim, which is used to run PopulationSim â€” a powerful demographic simulation tool that converts marginal control totals from the Estimates & Forecast team into micro-simulated households and individuals for use in the Activity-Based Model. For more details on running PopulationSim, please contact the Estimates & Forecast team. 

PopulationSim is well-suited for generating detailed household and person-level synthetic populations based on sample data and control totals. It is an important component in urban planning and transportation modeling. Learn more about PopulationSim in its [official documentation](https://activitysim.github.io/populationsim/)
