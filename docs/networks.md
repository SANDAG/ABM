# Networks

This page describes the components that make up the input ABM3 networks, which include the highway (i.e., roadways), transit and active transportation networks.

To learn how ABM3 handles the networks, refer to the [Network Import from TNED](design/supply/network-import-tned.md) page. 

## Transportation Network Editing Database (TNED)

The ABM3 networks are edited, maintained, and generated via SANDAG's internal Transportation Network Editing Database (TNED) system, which leverages ESRI's [ArcGIS Enterprise](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/get-started/latest/windows/what-is-arcgis-enterprise-.htm) and is hosted on an [enterprise geodatabase](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/manage-data/windows/enterprise-geodatabases-and-arcgis-enterprise.htm). The TNED system, via an [ETL](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/data-interoperability/what-is-the-data-interoperability-extension.htm) (Extract, Load, Transform) process, outputs the input ABM3 networks in a variety of different formats including [file geodatabase](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/geodatabases/manage-file-gdb/file-geodatabases.htm), CSV, and [shapefiles](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/shapefiles.htm).

When describing the ABM3 networks, this page is specifically referring to the networks in their post-ETL state. A typical TNED ETL network directory includes the following:

## EMME Outputs File Geodatabase

The ***EMMEOutputs.gdb*** is a file geodatabase that gets generated by the TNED ETL process. It houses link and node feature classes along with tables. The contents of the EMMEOutputs.gdb is as follows:

### TNED Transit Route Segment Mismatch Table

The ***ERROR_RouteSegmentMissingInHwyNetOrRailNet*** lists mismatches between the TransitRoute feature class and both the TNED_RailNet and TNED_HwyNet feature classes. If a transit route is coded along a rail or roadway segment that is not explicitly included in the network, it will flag the record. It should be noted that some records serve more as warnings rather than fatal errors. There are certain nuances, for example, for a proposed roadway that may have an uncertain horizon year and if a future transit route utilizes the roadway, the TNED ETL process will bring in the roadway as a bus-only street (no private vehicles allowed) as a fallback. This may be common in areas of the San Diego region where proposed development is far off in the future.

## Special Fares Text File

The ***special_fares.txt*** configures zone-based fare schemes and also houses the daily and regional pass fares. The Coaster is presently the only transit route in the San Diego region that has a zone-based fare system. To account for this, its fare structure is laid out in the special_fares.txt file. The contents of the file are as follow:

<br>
<div align="center">
    <img src="images\networks\special_fares.png" alt="SANDAG's input special fares file" title="special fares text file">
    <br>
    <em>special_fares.txt</em>
</div>
<br>

Under the **boarding_cost** section, the **base** sub-section provides the one-way fare (i.e., cost) for each direction of the coaster (i.e., line). Note that under this file, the Coaster is referenced via the RouteID (see RouteID under [TransitRoute](#tned-transit-route-feature-class) for further details) for each direction. The **stop_increment** section was previously utilized when the Coaster operated on a 4-zone fare system (prior to 2019) and therefore the cost values under that section are zeroed out.

The **in_vehicle_cost** section is where we can account for the zone-based fare system of the Coaster. Using the above excerpt as an example, the first 2 rows reference the Coaster in the southbound direction. When the Coaster passes through Solana Beach, it receives an additional $0.75 to the fare and another additional $0.75 when it passes through Sorrento Valley. The reverse is the same for the northbound direction with the only difference being the stations at which it receives the additional fares. The name of the station must be written out exactly as is it comes out in the network. The [trstop.csv](#transit-stops-csv-file) or may be referred to for exact Coaster station naming.

The last 2 elements of the special_fares.txt file are the **day_pass** and **regional_pass** fare variables. The day_pass refers to the daily pass that provides all-day access to the following routes: MTS Bus, MTS Trolley, MTS Rapid, Sprinter or Breeze. The regional_pass refers to the Coaster Adult 1-Day Pass which provdes all-day access to routes to the following routes: Coaster, Sprinter, Breeze, Flex, MTS Bus, MTS Trolley, MTS Rapid, MTS Rapid Express and MTS Rural. The newer Premium Regional Pass (presently $12) is not currently accounted for.

## Timed Transfer CSV Files

The ***timexfer_{time_of_day}.csv*** file contains the timed connections between the Coaster and feeder buses. There is a file present for each of the 5 time-of-days, which are EA (early AM), AM, MD (midday), PM, and EV (evening). 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Attribute</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>from_line</td>
        <td>Specifies the origin transit route RouteID (see RouteID under <a href=#tned-transit-route-feature-class>TransitRoute</a> for further details) transferring to the destination (to_line) transit route.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>to_line</td>
        <td>Specifies the destination transit route RouteID (see RouteID under <a href=#tned-transit-route-feature-class>TransitRoute</a> for further details) from which the origin (from_line) transit route transfers to.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>wait_time</td>
        <td>The specified transfer time between the origin (from_line) and destination (to_line) transit route.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The time-of-day timed transfer files were developed specifically for the Coaster given it is a high-end transit mode that has infrequent service in the base year and as a result, is difficult to calibrate. In order to model Coaster ridership that is closer to calibration targets, the timed transfer files were developed so that the travel demand model was informed of more realistic transfer times between the Coaster and feeder transit routes; this was done by comparing default transfer times and calculated average transfer times. Normally, the travel demand model defaults to a transfer time of half the transfer route's headway. For calculated average transfer times, the transit routes connecting to/from the Coaster were identified at each station for each of the 5 time-of-days and, using the Coaster and transfer route existing schedules, average transfer times were calculated. If the calculated average transfer time was lower than the default transfer time, the calculated average transfer time was added as a record to the corresponding time-of-day timed transfer file. Otherwise, it was omitted and the default transfer time was utilized by the model. The above methodology was carried out for the base year and subsequent future year files are subsets of it, where records may only be omitted (never added) if future frequency updates generate default transfer times that are less than the calculated average transfer times.

## Transit Links CSV File

The ***trlink.csv*** contains an ordered sequential list of underlying network links (arcs) for each transit route in the network. The records are ordered by the Route_ID attribute, which is not the same as the Route number, but rather a sequential transit route identifier unique to the network. It is recommended to refer to the <a href=#transit-routes-csv-file>trrt.csv</a> file's Route_ID to determine which transit route is being referenced. For each Route_ID, every row represents an underlying TNED_HwyNet (or TNED_RailNet) link the transit route is traversing over in order from start to finish.

## Transit Stops CSV File

The ***trstop.csv*** lists all transit stops for all transit routes in the network. The Route_ID in the file is not the same as the Route number, but rather a sequential transit route identifier unique to the network. It is recommended to refer to the <a href=#transit-routes-csv-file>trrt.csv</a> file's Route_ID to determine which transit route is being referenced.
